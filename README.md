### Question 1
If you are playing semantle for the first time, the objective is to guess a hidden word. The game will tell you how similar the word you guessed is to the hidden word. It will tell you if you are hot or cold. If you guess a word that is similar to the word, I would pull out a thesaurus and guess similar words. Using hints will help you learn words that are similar to the hidden word. If playing for the first time I would use a hint and then a thesaurus and try to understand what the theme is and then guess the word.

### Question 2
One of my favorite hobbies is paragliding. I currently live in Utah and we have tons of opportunity to do this. My favorite part of paragliding is ridge soaring. When winds hit ridges at a perpendicular angle they form updrafts. With a strong enough updraft you can fly along the ridge indefinitely. All of the hawks in the area come and hang out in the updrafts as well. Some of my most serene moments have been hangin out in the air.

### Question 3
If I could land a balloon anywhere, I would like to land on a small atol. I think it would be cool to land and explore a small island somewhere in the pacific or carribean. I love ocean views and warm weather.

### Question 4
I love weather and flying.
